# Reporting Security Issues

This project takes security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/tfasz/openvpn/security/advisories/new) tab.

We will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, we will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix 
and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.
